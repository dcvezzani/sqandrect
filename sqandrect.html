                    <p><span class="primary">M</span>y time spent in Nanjing truly was a special one
                    as it was my very first opportunity outside the USA. I was looking
                    forward to experiencing new sights, sounds, and flavors and I had
                    only been in the country for just a few short hours. Had it not been
                    for the kindness of perfect strangers, it is very likely that I would
                    have had a rough time getting to the hotel that had been previously
                    arranged for the group of study abroad students of which I was a part.</p>
                    
                    <p><span class="secondary">I</span>t was raining when the van pulled up to the hotel. I
                    did my best to graciously thank my driver and headed into the lobby of
                    the hotel. There I was, face to face with the Chinese language. They
                    only spoke numbers in English to help me understand amounts of money
                    owed, etc. After paying what I could only assume was either the correct,
                    or perhaps more than correct, amount of money for my room, I carried my
                    luggage to my room to take a small break from the very different world
                    I was in.</p>
                    
                    <p><span class="secondary">I</span> have a hard time recollecting what took place next,
                    except that I remember feeling nervous about navigating my way around
                    Nanjing without a map. However, my days of playing text-based MUDs online
                    provided me with some amount of confidence to wander about in areas
                    very, very unfamiliar to me without getting lost. I stumbled upon a small
                    soup kitchen and ordered what the guy siting at the table to my right
                    had ordered.</p>
